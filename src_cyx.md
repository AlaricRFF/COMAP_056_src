## First Problem

### Variables:

- Users total demand: $D_t$

- Users actual usage: $D_a$ (considering some users don't use full allocations)

- Evaporation rate: $v_e$, fixed under assumed temperature and air flow rate above the water. Reference: [Evaporation from a Water Surface](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/evaporation-water-surface-d_690.html)
  
  ### Further concerns, within $D_a$ , we can make classifications:
  
  -  Agriculture usage: **$D_{arg}$**, which varies with seasons, may have multiple peaks considering different planatation.
  
  - Daily usage by residents: $D_{res}$, which is normally distributed
